# ðŸ“¡ Investigate Unicast, Broadcast, and Multicast Traffic

## Topology

In this lab, we're going to explore how different types of network trafficâ€”unicast, broadcast, and multicastâ€”behave in a network. Most of the traffic you'll encounter is unicast, but understanding the distinctions between these types of traffic is crucial.

### Objectives
1. Generate Unicast Traffic
2. Generate Broadcast Traffic
3. Investigate Multicast Traffic

## Part 1: Generate Unicast Traffic

Let's kick things off by generating unicast traffic using a simple ping command. 

First, I hop over to **PC1** and open the **Command Prompt** from the **Desktop** tab. I enter the command `ping 10.0.3.2` to initiate the ping. As expected, the ping succeeds, confirming that the network is functioning as intended.

</p>

Now, let's switch to **Simulation Mode**. I click on the **Simulation** tab and make sure that only ICMP and EIGRP events are selected in **Edit Filters**. Once thatâ€™s set up, I run the ping command again from **PC1** to `10.0.3.2` and start analyzing the traffic.

</p>

As the packet travels from **PC1** to **Router3**, I use the **Capture/Forward** button to step through each stage of the journey. Watching the ICMP echo request and reply move between the devices is pretty fascinating. The packet travels through **PC1** -> **Switch** -> **Router1** -> **Router3** and then back through the same path.

</p>

To dive deeper, I open up the PDU information for the first event in the **Simulation Panel Event List**. Here, we can see that the transmission starts at **Layer 3** because of the ICMP & IP protocol usage. When the packet reaches **Router3**, the source and destination IP addresses flip. This behavior is a hallmark of unicast traffic.

</p>

Once Iâ€™m done analyzing, I hit the **Reset Simulation** button to clear the traffic.

## Part 2: Generate Broadcast Traffic

Next, weâ€™ll generate some broadcast traffic. To do this, I use the **Add Complex PDU** tool. This tool is handy for creating custom test packets. 

I click **Add Complex PDU** and move the cursor over to **PC1** to set it as the source. The **Create Complex PDU** dialog pops up, where I enter `255.255.255.255` as the destination IP addressâ€”this is the broadcast address. I keep the **Select Application** option on **PING** and then hit **Create PDU**.

</p>

This action generates a broadcast packet that I can now see in the **Simulation Panel Event List**. I click **Capture/Forward** a couple of times, and I observe the packet being sent to the switch and then broadcasted to **PC2**, **PC3**, and **Router1**. 

<p align="center">

</p>

Diving into the Layer 3 details, I notice that the broadcast packet transforms into a unicast response as it reaches the other devices. Interestingly, this broadcast doesn't extend beyond **Router1** to **Router2** or **Router3**. The reason? A limited broadcast packet is designed to stay within the LAN unless the router is explicitly configured to forward it.

</p>

Once Iâ€™ve observed the broadcast behavior, I delete the test packet by clicking **Delete** under Scenario 0.

## Part 3: Investigate Multicast Traffic

Now, let's examine multicast traffic. Multicast is a bit different from unicast and broadcast. To explore this, I use the traffic generated by the EIGRP routing protocol.

I click **Capture/Forward** to see EIGRP packets at **Router1** waiting to be multicast out to each interface. By opening up the PDU information, I can observe that these packets are sent to **224.0.0.10**, the multicast address for EIGRP routers.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5688843a-93e4-4eb8-bdd1-9906bbdd35ab" height="100%" width="100%" alt=""/>
</p>

As the packets move through the network, the routers process them since they belong to the multicast group, but the PCs simply drop themâ€”no further processing is needed. The destination address of these packets is always `224.0.0.10`, which is specifically reserved for EIGRP.

When I click on one of the packets delivered to a PC, it's evident that the PC discards it without any additional processing, as expected.

### Conclusion

By exploring unicast, broadcast, and multicast traffic, we've seen firsthand how data is transmitted across a network:
- **Unicast traffic** is a direct transmission from one device to another.
- **Broadcast traffic** is sent to all devices within a network, but only those that need to respond do so.
- **Multicast traffic** is sent to a specific group, and only devices within that group process it.

Understanding these differences is key to mastering network traffic behavior!
